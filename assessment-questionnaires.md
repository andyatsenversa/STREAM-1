### Scoring Guide

**How to Calculate Your Maturity Score:**
1. Calculate the average score across all questions
2. Calculate dimension scores by averaging questions within each section
3. Identify highest and lowest scoring areas 
4. Prioritize improvement actions based on business impact

**Interpretation of Overall Scores:**
- **1.0-1.9**: Initial/Ad Hoc - Undefined processes requiring substantial improvement
- **2.0-2.9**: Developing - Basic processes established but inconsistently applied
- **3.0-3.9**: Defined - Standardized processes with reasonable implementation
- **4.0-4.5**: Managed - Quantitative management with solid performance 
- **4.6-5.0**: Optimizing - Industry-leading practices with continuous innovation

**Next Steps:**
1. Review your completed assessment with your team
2. Identify 3-5 priority improvement opportunities
3. Develop specific action plans for each priority area
4. Establish a timeline for implementation
5. Schedule a follow-up assessment in 6-12 months
